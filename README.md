 PassGAN Evaluation
=======================

This is the release code repository for the evaluation of PassGAN(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.00440.pdf) built using Tensorflow 2, Python 3.7, Keras and Numpy to the described specification.
It contains my Tensorflow 2 implementation of an Improved Wasserstein GAN (IWGAN) with the intent of comparing the results found in the aformentioned paper.


## Getting Started

python GAN.py -dataset rock_you -batch_size 64 -layer_dim 128 && tensorboard --log_dir logs/gradient_tape

### Prerequisites

System Software

```
Ubuntu 19.10+ or suitable Docker environment https://www.docker.com/get-started
```

```
TENSORFLOW-GPU 2.1 https://www.tensorflow.org/
```

```
